###React-Electron Boilerplate###

###Objectives:###
1. Create an easy to deploy, easy to understand React-Electron application (referred to from now on as Reactron (trademark CGJEROW, 2017)).
2. Create documentation and tutorials for how to build and deploy a web application for total web development beginners or beginners to NodeJS, React or Electron, so that all can answer the elusive WHY of web development
 1. Describe the benefits of each node module added to the project and how this application leverages those benefits
 2. Utilize feedback and create an open and encouraging environment for developers and "ordinaries" alike.
   1. This includes not calling people ordinaries
3. Automate boilerplate deployment based on different use cases and project goals


###Current State: ###
Reactron is a simple boilerplate for getting an Electron-React developer environment up and running. As of now it is limited to a development environment without build scripts for production or logic to identify current environment.

###Next Steps (ordered by priority):###
1. Add build scripts to deploy app, so that the boilerplate reaches our Minimally Viable Product (MVP). This just means that it has all of the base functionality necessary to actually do what we want it to do.
2. Create documentation for the repo, adding descriptions of the different packages/modules we are using and why. When I first started in web development there were a lot of times I asked myself "why" and had to forge ahead with only the answer of "because it works"
3. Build options into boilerplate deployment to begin with a more robust application depending on use cases yet to be identified.
 1. *Note* If you have a suggestion for something you would like the option of having built into the repo please reach out via Issues for now! I would like to build a public backlog for this project
